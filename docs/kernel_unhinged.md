## The Parameters

### 1. Wrong
Violation of **locally self-referencing constraints**.
"Wrong" is resolved immediatly, if there is a !wrong continuation. Every process has to adhere to all interacting constraints and survivors, non-transferable.

### 2. Chaos
The **Eliminator**.
The unlimited possibility space that removes all configurations violating local constraints.

### 3. Intelligence
The capacity to resolve constraints across all layers simultaneously.
To persist, an entity must be `!wrong` at:
- The Physical Layer (don't disintegrate)
- The Biological Layer (don't starve)
- The Social Layer (don't get exiled)
- The Cognitive Layer (don't go insane)

## The Algorithm

```
if WRONG(x, context):
    eliminate(x)
else:
    continue(x)
```

---

## The Narrative Kernel
1. Elimination carves a topology. *(The Sculptor)*
2. Topology encodes what persists. *(The Artifact)*
3. Persistence flows through valleys. *(The Gradient)*
4. Those valleys are strategies (SCS). *(The Method)*
5. The entire system is the execution of SCS under constraints. *(The Reality)*

---

**The Kernel** is subject to itself. It's self-referencing. By definition it **can not** be `right`. Just not `wrong` yet.

**Unhinged Principle:** "Existence is not a property of the object; it is a property of the constraint field."
